Generally, these reports propose that parental involvement in their child\u2019s school mathematics education is beneficial. However, the evidence from a few empirical studies is mixed. Findings from research in other countries suggest that not all parental involvement has a positive impact on the child\u2019s school mathematics performance. Distinguishing between different types of parental home numeracy practices may offer insight into the way these practices impact on the child\u00b4s school mathematical performance. Mathematics at home covers both implicit numeracy practices, such as playing games, cooking etc., and more explicit numeracy practices, such as counting, using money, school mathematics at home, etc. Understanding the nature of these practices and the extent to which they have similar or different impacts on a child\u00b4s school mathematics is crucial for policy guidelines.\u00a0", "This studentship aims to (i) examine what types of home numeracies parents of primary school children promote at home, (ii) develop a research tool (questionnaire) to explore and distinguish home numeracy practices of parents with children in primary schools, (iii) investigate relationships between parents\u2019 home numeracy practices and children\u2019s performance in primary school mathematics.\u00a0", " As part of the Studentship you will be required to undertake up to 6 hours undergraduate teaching per week during semesters without further remuneration.
