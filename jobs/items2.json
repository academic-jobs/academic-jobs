However, such techniques are not utilised to a large extent in the processing of UK nuclear legacy suspension wastes, due to the potential impact of the organic species on downstream processing (e.g. encapsulation). Nevertheless, the extremely low concentrations required with large molecular weight polymers (which can be down to a few parts per million) is often below levels of other organic species already present in pond sludges, such as algae, which would suggest that downstream risk can be minimised with appropriate selection of a highly efficiency flocculant.", "The advantage of flocculation is that is can promote rapid aggregation, increasing sedimentation and separation of even small micron sized fines. Additionally, the open networks of flocculated aggregates can lead to a much higher dewatering capacity with filtration or other downstream techniques (as they are less susceptible to filter blinding). Hence, this PhD seeks to understand the interaction of flocculation agents on the behaviour of legacy waste sludge test materials, focusing in three key areas; the settling rate and segregation of suspensions; the surface chemistry interactions of the components; and the advantages of flocculation on filtration or flotation dewatering performance.", "This fully funded four-year PhD studentship is being offered as part of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Nuclear Fission \u2013 Next Generation Nuclear.", "You will take part in a taught and training programme during the first year.

The data used for testing often has deficiencies in it (from either experimental or analytical sources). Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is a technology that yields exact solutions to the equations governing fluid flow, provided sufficiently accurate numerical solution methods are employed. Its use has been limited in the past due to the large computing resource required to achieve the required level of grid refinement needed in obtaining sufficiently resolved (spatially and temporally) solutions. Given the availability of modern high performance computers, however, this situation has changed in recent years, and it is now possible to obtain DNS solutions to practically relevant problems in reasonable computer run times.", "In this project, methodologies will be developed using DNS such that fluid flow benchmark problems can be subsequently studied to give much needed data to compare existing methods against. Applications where there is a particular sparsity of data include multi-phase flows (i.e. flows containing fluids and solids), such as found in waste management and decommissioning. The project will therefore focus on such flows, obtaining exact solutions to a range of generic flows of value to the validation of the models used in the industry. Given the fundamental nature of such simulations, the information derived from them will also be analysed to provide improved understanding of a range of practically relevant flows, of value in the design of improved treatment methods.", "The key aim is to extend a predictive model, based on direct numerical simulation, to include a particle tracking technique, capable of predicting the types of flow encountered in waste management and decommissioning. Generic flows will be considered, as will be the dispersion, deposition and re-suspension behaviour of solid particles. Non-spherical particles, and models for particle agglomeration and break-up, will be considered.

It is a way of allowing lay representatives to influence the research agenda. Palliative care is an approach which aims to improve the quality of life of people facing life limiting illnesses such as cancer, respiratory disease, heart disease and dementia. Service user involvement is complex and challenging within the context of palliative care research as patients and their carers face significant symptom burden, patients may be close to death, and carers may be bereaved. Palliative care research has often been criticised for failing to meet the needs of the end user. Despite these challenges, no evidence based guidelines exist which support ethical and sensitive approaches to involving service users in palliative care research,", "The aim of this mixed methods PhD studentship will be to develop and evaluate guidance for service user involvement in palliative care research, through meeting the following objectives:", "(1) Evaluate the evidence base surrounding service user involvement in palliative care. This will be achieved through a systematic review and critical evaluation of published literature.", "(2) Develop guidance for service user involvement in palliative care research. It is anticipated that this phase will involve the use of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. Existing guidance on service user involvement in health care research will be reviewed and evaluated. Qualitative research will be used to explore the views and perspectives of key stakeholders (including service users, palliative care clinicians and academics).

Among the top tips for having better conversations with people with aphasia is to tolerate longer silences. For example,\u00a0", "\u00a0suggests: \"listen patiently and give me time\"; the Stroke Association funded the \u201cAsk.Wait.Listen\u201d campaign for GP surgeries, and the Stroke Association suggests, \"Give the person time to take in what you say and to respond\". Although this advice comes from work involving people with aphasia themselves, recent research suggests that there is a clear need to understand the particulars of how silences operate in conversations involving people with aphasia.", "The main thrust of the research will be to investigate the taken-for-granted claim that because people with aphasia have had a brain injury resulting in language impairment, their silences should be treated as a reflex of the additional processing time needed to decode/encode language. However, silence can be a way of indicating meaning in conversation; one may purposefully withhold answers to questions to indicate a negative response. Silences thus play a powerful role in displaying disagreement, and non-alignment with what a co-conversationalist is saying (Heritage 1984, Jefferson 1989). It may be that in some cases people with aphasia are manipulating silences to this end, but there is no published research on the interactional use of silences in conversations involving people with aphasia.", "The research will use Conversation Analysis (CA) to analyse videorecordings of normally-occurring interactions between people with aphasia and the staff caring for them. The project has scope to be shaped to investigate either therapeutic conversations between SLTs and people with aphasia, or conversations between people with aphasia and other members of the multi-disciplinary team, such as nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, consultants, etc. The aim of the research is to gain a better understanding of the use of this unprepossessing but vitally important element of conversational structure, and to use that information to facilitate better communication between health care staff and people with aphasia.", "Candidates must have a first or upper second class honors degree or significant research experience.

This work, alongside parallel experimental investigations at NNL on the low and high level boiling rigs, and at Heriot Watt on the simulated evaporator apparatus, has given significant support to the hypothesis that the flow in the HALES evaporator has the structure of an unconstrained thermosyphon system, with most boiling occurring due to flash evaporation close to the top of the vessel. The liquor temperature close to the bottom of the evaporator is approximately that corresponding to the saturated temperature of the liquor at the ullage pressure. Hence the liquor is subcooled in relation to the local saturated temperature at the higher pressure due to the liquor head. There is evidence from temperature measurements of the liquor during recent batches in the current Hales evaporators of the liquor being subcooled. This implies that the metal temperatures at the base and elsewhere in the evaporators are considerably lower than present predictions. If ultimately proved to be correct, this hypothesis will have significant impact on calculations of the expected life time of the current evaporators, and the design of future evaporators.", "In order to refine this model further to give accurate predictions of temperatures and flows inside the evaporators, and to assist in future design work, further work is required in the following areas:", "For more information, visit:\u00a0", "September/October 2016", "For further information please contact Abigail Ward: (", ")", "Informal enquiries about the project, contact Alan Burns (", "). \u00a0", "\u00a0(if English is not your first language, then candidates must also meet the University\u2019s English language requirements):", "A good degree (first class or upper second) in a relevant discipline, such as physical, earth or environmental sciences, or an appropriate branch of engineering", "UK applicants will be eligible for a full award paying tuition fees and maintenance.

Non-ideality is fundamental also to the interpretation of any processes involving partitioning between phases.", "The energy landscape concept is increasingly valuable in understanding and unifying the structural, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of inorganic solids.\u00a0 In general examining the energy landscapes of disordered materials and solid solutions highlights the local structural environments which are present. Consideration of the average structure alone is not sufficient, and at worst can be highly misleading. Many important solid solutions are strongly non-ideal and accurate calculation of thermodynamic properties (e.g. enthalpies, free energies) as a function of temperature remains challenging.", "We are developing a number of computational methods for non-ideal solid solutions and grossly non-stoichiometric compounds. Any technique must be able to sample many different arrangements of ions, and it is also crucial to allow for the local structural relaxation around each ion. These reduce considerably the energy associated with any exchange.\u00a0 Such contributions must not be averaged out!

They are built by chemical modification of protein scaffolds with catalytic functionalities that are not available in nature, thus expanding the catalytic scope of enzymes towards non-natural activities. Their active site consists of a hydrophobic pocket, which is large enough to accommodate a chemical catalyst and a non-natural substrate. The design of these hybrid catalysts is typically time and resource-consuming work based on intuition and screening. Few examples of computational design have been reported.", "This project will combine the power of computational and experimental strategies in order to improve the design of hybrid catalysts for non-natural reactions. In order to fully benefit from the architecture of an enzymatic active site, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) will be used as scaffolds. These enzymes stabilise the transition state of carbonyl reductions, but are inactive towards the reduction of other unsaturated carbon-heteroatom bonds. Therefore, we aim to expand the range of reductive transformations catalysed by ADHs.", "The approach will start with computational evaluation of model active sites for the reaction of interest outside the protein, which will be validated by synthesis and testing of the chemical catalysts in the lab. The small chemical catalysts will then be incorporated inside the protein scaffold. At this stage docking and modelling will identify useful modifications of the enzyme (genetic) or the catalyst (chemical) in order to position the chemical catalyst and to modulate its reactivity inside the protein pocket. Suggestions from the computational design will subsequently be used to construct and test the hybrid catalysts.", "The project will involve computational modelling and design, including classical methods such as substrate protein docking and molecular mechanics, as well as accurate quantum chemical calculations. Synthetic and analytical chemistry will be applied to prepare the chemical catalysts. Protein production methods have already been developed in our lab and the student will learn and apply them to this project.

Successful completion of the year-one program leads to the award of an Oxford MSc, and progression to the 3-year PhD project based in Bristol, and detailed below.\u00a0Using dynamics to steer chemical reaction outcomes in condensed phases\u00a0The mechanisms whereby chemical reactions produce stereoisomeric excesses of particular products has long been a topic of interest. For example, natural systems have evolved to utilize specific enantiomeric forms of their constituent biomolecules. Understanding why this is the case remains an outstanding fundamental question with impacts on several scientific fields. More practically, understanding the mechanisms whereby chemical reactions produce excesses of particular product stereoisomers also has considerable importance in synthetic chemistry, because it enables us to design rational synthetic strategies that efficiently target specific molecules.\u00a0In recently published work, we have used state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations to highlight a system where reactions can be dynamically steered to form particular products, with a product ratio that depends on the solvent in which the reaction takes place. In this project you will use and develop state-of-the-art molecular dynamics machinery recently developed in our groups to carry on these studies, and apply them to reactions taking place in enantiomerically pure chiral solvents and in supercritical fluids.\u00a0The project will be undertaken at the University of Bristol in the Centre for Computational Chemistry, under the primary supervision of Dr. David Glowacki, with Prof Barry Carpenter as secondary supervisor. The project will involve a range of skills, including methods development, writing computer code, and applications run on supercomputing facilities.\u00a0[1] Carpenter et al., PCCP, 2015, ", ", 8372-8381 [2] ", "; Glowacki et al., ", " ", "Please make an online application for this PhD position at ", "For further details please see ", "UK or EU citizen (fully funded).

There are many very good texts that describe meta-analysis methods and applications [Borenstein et al. (2011), Hartung et al. (2011) and Cumming (2013)]. The popularity of the use of meta-analytic methods continues to rise exponentially. Consequently, providing improved statistical methods which do not suffer from the problems faced by many existing methods is extremely important, Kulinskaya et al. (2013).", "The standard fixed effect models and random effects models (REMs) for meta-analysis have been widely criticised, the former for being over-simplistic in assuming equal study effects, and the latter for assuming that inter-study variation can all be captured in one random observation per study. Thus despite the widespread usage of such models, it is important to develop somewhat more complex models that describe the within and between study variation more realistically.", "This project aims to do this by introducing flexible 2-level fixed and random effects models. At level 1, these models allow for a large (comparable with within-studies sample sizes) unknown random number of clusters within each study. For example in a large epidemiological meta-study with individual studies measuring some continuous variable, each study itself could be carried out on an unknown number of clusters of individuals with the same genotypes. At level 2, an additional random variance component may be added to account for between-study variation, resulting in a more flexible \u2018cluster REM\u2019.", "This project will contribute to the UEA-based part of the methodology stream of the ESRC-funded Business and Local Government) BLG centre.

This project will combine experimental research at the John Innes Centre, a world leading plant and microbial research institute, with valuable industrial experience at one of UK's leading wheat breeders, KWS UK. The project will investigate a variation of flower arrangements on the wheat inflorescence, known as paired spikelets, which are characterised by the formation of two floral branches where normally only one branch forms. Advanced genetic resources will be used to identify regions of the genome, including specific genes, which contribute to paired spikelet development, and alleles of these genes will be introduced into commercial wheat varieties to determine the effect of paired spikelet formation on grain production and yields. This research will therefore provide information about new genetic targets that could be used by breeders to increase grain production in wheat by modifying inflorescence architecture and development. The project will also provide the student with unique laboratory and industry-based training, primarily in the UK but also in continental Europe, and will therefore place the student in an exceptional position to develop a career in academia or with a commercial breeding company.\u00a0", "This Industrial CASE project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

Fungicides offer a viable means to control FHB, but control of DON contamination of grain is difficult on highly susceptible varieties.

Network representation has furthered our understanding of how changes in cellular processes can lead to complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. For example, autophagy (self-eating), which is important to degrade unwanted cellular compartments, was found to be regulated by various molecular networks. Interestingly, autophagy not only degrades damaged host molecules but also intracellular pathogens. Conversely, autophagy is often manipulated by various pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella. Deregulation of autophagy can often lead to cancer progression. Better understanding the effect of certain bacterial species, particularly pathogens such as Salmonella, on the regulation of human intestinal autophagy could help us to propose IBD and colon cancer prognosis markers.", "In this PhD project, the student will work under the primary supervision of Tamas Korcsmaros, TGAC Computational Biology Fellow, to examine the effect of Salmonella genes on the host signalling network, especially on those pathways that control host autophagy in the gut. The PhD student will have opportunity to learn novel technologies, programming languages, and experimental techniques to grow and develop to be a happy, independent and successful researcher in the field of systems biology. In the former group of the primary supervisor, several students have already been successfully trained to carry out computational works independently and publish several papers in leading journals, indicating the availability of necessary training experience.

This is because the wonderful redox properties of iron, which make it such a good enzyme catalyst, also help to generate harmful oxygen radicals.", "All organisms including plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate the uptake, transport, storage and use of iron. This regulatory process requires the ability to sense the intracellular iron concentration. While iron signalling is well studied in bacteria, fungi and animals, neither the iron sensing protein(s) nor the iron sensing mechanism are known in plants.", "To address this major gap in our knowledge, we have recently generated promoter-luciferase constructs that report iron deficiency by \u2018glowing in the dark\u2019 well before any visible signs of iron deficiency such as chlorosis. A mutant screen will be carried out for plants that miss-regulate the expression of the luciferase reporter in response to iron.

Our study will investigate the assemblies that are derived from coiled-coil building blocks with unusual characteristics.

During the proposed project we will derive short coiled-coil oligopeptides based on sequence analysis of naturally occurring coiled-coil proteins. We will use biochemical and biophysical technologies to investigate and characterise the higher order assemblies generated by these oligopeptides.

Hydrogels show great promise in biomedical applications, drug delivery in particular, but also in clinical practice and experimental medicine for a wide range of applications (tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, diagnostics, cellular immobilization, separation of biomolecules or cells). Within the broad chemical family of \"sugars\", polysaccharides are excellent biopolymers for hydrogel preparation in biomedical contexts: they are non-toxic, water-soluble with high capability for swelling induced by simple chemical modifications, and they can be biodegraded to nontoxic products that are easily assimilated by the body. Great advances in polymer preparation for hydrogels (enzymatic procedures, nanocomposites, etc.) needs to be followed by an understanding at molecular level of the processes of gelation, the role of water, and the impact on final performance. In this project we will use state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy (solution, solid, and gel state advanced experiments) to deepen our understanding of the molecular details of novel hydrogel materials based on starch and nanocellulose fibres. We will use cutting-edge glycobiology techniques (enzymatic and click chemistry) for functionalisation of nanocrystalline cellulose, prepare advanced materials (nanocomposite and interpenetrating network hydrogels), and will develop novel NMR spectroscopic protocols to understand the structure and dynamics of the biomaterials.

Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcriptional elongation is important in stem cells and tumour cells, but its role in the whole animal during development is only now being fully explored. We use neural crest (NC) cells, which are a multipotent population of cells that migrate during early development from the dorsal neural tube throughout the embryo where they differentiate into a variety of cell types including pigment cells, cranio-facial cartilage and sensory neurons. How specification of the NC is both spatially and temporally regulated during embryonic development is still unresolved and this project will test the role of c-Myc. We have shown that c-Myc is regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation. c-Myc is also regulated by Wnt signalling but exactly how is not clear. Wnts are extracellular signalling proteins and both Wnt and c-Myc are known to be important for NC specification.\u00a0 In this project the student will determine how Wnt signalling controls c-Myc activation and stabilization during NC specification.

Occasionally, a pathogen strain evolves to infect a new host \u2013 a process known as a \u201chost jump\u201d. Host jumps exert a strong selection pressure on the effectors to adapt to their new host environment, ultimately leading to effector and pathogen specialization. This project investigates pathogen adaptation and effector specialization after a host jump in the rice blast fungus, a complex pathogen of grasses. The rice blast fungus is critical for global food security as the main destroyer of the rice crop. It secretes a multitude of effectors. Avr-Pik is one such effector that targets rice proteins containing heavy metal associated (HMA) domains to enhance virulence. However, rice uses HMAs as sensors integrated in an immune receptor that detects Avr-Pik to mount defence. Recently, the crystal structure of a complex between Avr-Pik and the HMA from the immune receptor Pikp has been determined in our Laboratories. We showed that the affinity between Avr-Pik and HMA determined the sensitivity of the immune receptor. This offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the effect of natural variations on affinity between Avr-Piks and HMAs at the biochemical level. This project aims to exploit natural variation in effector and host proteins to fine-tune the sensor in Pikp to recognize a broader range of blast fungi.", "The student will be based at The Sainsbury Laboratory and the John Innes Centre providing world class multidisciplinary training including bioinformatics, molecular biology, biochemistry and synthetic biology to successfully complete this project.

Within the UK, we have previously shown that not all migrant populations are declining, and that resident and migrant populations tend to both be faring better in the same areas.

Obligate or facultative cavity-nesting species regularly adopt artificial nest sites and their provision is therefore widely used as a conservation tool to release populations from nest site limitation. However, artificial nest boxes often have high levels of non-target occupancy, potentially imposing both direct and indirect costs to individuals of the target species. Effective conservation management requires that the implications of these costs are traded-off against the intended benefits so that, if necessary, appropriate mitigation action can be undertaken but they remain poorly understood.", "This project will investigate avoidance, competition and predation costs associated with non-target species occupancy within nest box communities.

Using a combination of observational and experimental field work at study sites in France and Latvia and laboratory analyses of feather samples to determine diet-based isotopic signatures at UEA, the student will define the dominance hierarchy within each nest box community, determine its influence on the spatial and temporal structuring of Roller breeding attempts and explore the consequences for subsequent productivity.

Comparability study of chassis growth, and identification and development of exemplar bioparts for AMR products will be undertaken.

Here, dense waters formed by rapid cooling in the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas rapidly descend into the abyss, where they form the densest component of the North Atlantic\u2019s overturning circulation. This circulation is responsible for the mild climate of Northwest Europe, and hence it is imperative to understand its resilience to ocean warming and freshening in response to climate change. Recent results, however, show that there is a significant component of dense water that is routed onto the shelves of East Greenland to the south of Denmark Strait, where it is mixed rapidly with other water masses.

We know that one of the main causes of the mutations that lead to cancer development are unrepaired mistakes that arise during the process of DNA replication. We have learned a lot about this process over the years but very little is known as to how this process finishes.", "In our recent work we have shown a first glimpse of the mechanism that unloads the replication machinery (replisome) at the end of replication. The replisome is formed of about 150 proteins and build around a few key organising centers. One of them is a replicative helicase, which is the protein complex that can unwind double stranded DNA to open it to create the templates for DNA synthesis. The helicases are loaded onto DNA in hundreds of thousands, and about 30-50 thousand of them are activated per cell during DNA replication. They then go through DNA unwinding it until they meet a helicase coming from the opposite direction. These helicases once working are very precious as if they get taken off DNA by mistake they cannot be put back on, which means however that at the end, when they meet each other they have to be taken off by some sophisticated mechanism. Our recent work determined the first insights into this disassembly mechanism (see reference) and now we plan to learn the identity of all of the essential factors needed for its execution. We also plan to establish the importance of this process for genome maintenance and cancer development. With 30-50 thousand terminating helicases it is enough that only a small proportion of them have problems to create a lot of mutations and possibly allow cancer formation.", "DNA replication is such a fundamental biological process that it is incredibly well conserved throughout evolution.

This is a fundamental question, touching the very basics of our understanding of neural computation and hence one of the most exciting topics in neuroscience. However, current data analysis approaches are unable to reconstruct in detail neural dynamics generating cognitive decisions (Gerstner et al., 2013, Science).", "A classical view on neural computation is that it can be characterized in terms of convergence to metastable i.e. temporarily stable \"attracting states\u201d; which map e.g., memory patterns or stimuli representations. This hypothesis underlies almost all models of decision-making: the existence of neural states towards which activity of neural constellations converges, despite the intrinsic neuronal noise, while processing similar cognitive entities. Unfortunately, such metastable states have only been found empirically in sensory systems and in deep areas such as hippocampus; while in cortical regions associated to decision-making there are only few preliminary attempts (e.g., Lapish & Balaguer-Ballester and colleagues, 2015 Journal of Neuroscience).", "Thus, in general, there is no robust empirical basis for selecting among competing theories of high cognitive functions. The main reasons are: (1) the technical difficulty of performing simultaneous recordings in different cortical regions in behaving animals and hence to establish causal relationships among them and (2) the lack of analysis methods for a reliable identification of neural network metastable dynamics empirically.", "The aim of this project is to provide analysis and modelling tools\u00a0which enables us to derive a conclusive demonstration of metastable dynamics in high cognitive areas such as frontal cortex. This would be of paramount importance for deciding among competing decision- making models and a highly significant advance; for instance the discovery of such attracting states in hippocampus (by the British scientist John O'Kefee) deserved to win the last Nobel Prize. This is a purely scientific goal with no immediate clinical application. Nevertheless, altered brain dynamics is well-known to underlie, for instance, hyperactivity disorders or schizophrenia. Therefore, identifying network dynamics is a prerequisite for the future design of pharmacological cocktails which have a modulatory effect on altered activity dynamics.", "The objectives of the project are to:", "(1) undertake state-of-the-art recordings in behaving rats in different cortical regions simultaneously at professor Sanchez-Vives\u2019 lab, one of the leading centres in animal electrophysiology; where the renowned \"up-down\" states driving spontaneous brain activity were first identified (Sanchez-Vives et al., 1997 Science; 2000 Nature Neurosci). The experimental paradigm will be then extended to human subjects at the Bournemouth University Electroencephalography (EEG) lab. lead by Drs Xun He and Angela Goslin.", "(2) Develop innovative approaches designed for a reliable identification of metastable dynamics of neural ensembles underlying cognitive decisions. The methods will consist of a fusion of theoretically robust approaches to pattern discovery and recent trajectory coherence methods for identifying attractor dynamics (e.g., Balaguer-Ballester and colleagues, 2015 J Neurosci; 2014 Plos 1, 2011 Plos Comput Biology, PNAS). The novel approach will reconstruct neural ensemble dynamics during tasks specifically designed to this goal both in animals and in human subjects.", "Funded candidates will receive a maintenance grant of \u00a314,000 per annum (unless otherwise specified), to cover their living expenses and have their fees waived for 36 months.

Perception of PAMPs triggers a signaling network that includes activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), activation of defence gene expression and ultimately leads to PAMP triggered immunity (PTI). Perception of PAMPs also leads to growth inhibition, by mostly unknown signaling events. Since the regulation of growth also involves receptor-mediated perception of plant peptides there is potential for cross regulation. Some connections have already been identified that suggest some of the signaling components are shared between PRR signaling and plant peptide signaling, such at co-receptor BAK1 (1). Furthermore, perception of plant peptides has recently also been linked to negative regulation of defense response and suppresses resistance to microbial pathogens (2,3). The current project investigates the links between PRR signaling and plant peptide signaling controlling growth. In the current project the receptor based signaling event will be studied with advanced proteomics approaches and cell biology (using confocal microscopy).

To understand how fruits grow into such different sizes and shapes requires unravelling the way that cell division and expansion within the organ are regulated. This PhD project will use mathematical modelling and computer simulations to unravel the interplay between the plant hormone auxin and fruit growth, in a close collaboration between the theoretical lab of Stan Mar\u00e9e and the experimental lab of Lars \u00d8stergaard. The project will specifically focus on species within the Brassicaceae family. This family includes the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as well as important crop species such as oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Fruits from both Arabidopsis and B. napus develop as cylindrical siliques, while fruits from other Brassicaceae species can be flat and heart-shaped (such as Capsella rubella) or flat and circular (such as Ledipium campestre). Unravelling the cellular basis of this diversity in shapes is the objective of this project. The hypothesis is that auxin functions as a core regulator of the axiality and strength in growth and rate of divisions. Given that growth-induced changes in tissue shape directly impact auxin dynamics and transport, we expect essential feedbacks from the growth on the auxin patterning, and thus on growth, division and differentiation itself. Unravelling this feedback loop requires an integrative modelling approach, in which the student will be developing predictive cellular-based models of fruit growth, which combine models of how auxin flows through the tissue with models that describe the regulation of cell expansion and cell cycle. Such models should allow to unravel what underlies the acquisition of the diverse fruit shapes.", "This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

Their role is to control the topological state of DNA, for example, during replication and transcription. Because of their essential nature they have become key drug targets for a number of antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. All topoisomerases can relax DNA, i.e. remove supercoils, but DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential in all bacteria, can also introduce supercoils. Although gyrase is an archetypal bacterial enzyme, it has also been found in plants, e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana, and plasmodial parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum (a causative agent of malaria). The discovery of gyrase in these organisms presents the opportunity for determining the physiological role of the enzyme in eukaryotes, and raises the possibility of developing herbicides and anti-malarial agents. A. thaliana gyrase has been expressed in insect cells using baculovirus vectors but has so-far remained largely uncharacterised. In this project the student will characterise plant gyrase and investigate its role in chloroplast and mitochondria DNA replication, and develop inhibitors of the enzyme. They will also establish methods for producing and characterising the P. falciparum enzyme and explore the possibilities of developing new malaria agents targeted to this enzyme.", "This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

In contrast, it is the minority of interactions that permit lifecycle completion of the pathogen. The proclivity of nonhost resistance to the majority of pathogens suggests plants have a substantial capacity to resist various pathogens and/or that pathogens must make crucial adaptations to proliferate on a plant species. We have identified a resistance locus that conditions resistance to the ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi Magnaporthe oryzae and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. These two pathogens cause significant impact on global wheat and rice production, and the possibility that the same immune receptor conditions multiple pathogen recognition has profound implications in plant pathology. The project will involve the isolation of the fungal immune receptor through a combination of map-based cloning, association genetics, and bioinformatics.", "This PhD project will be supervised by Dr Matthew Moscou at The Sainsbury Laboratory.

Given the increasing amount of pathogens causing diseases in crops that coincide with serious yield losses, understanding how plants defend against pathogens is of major interest to agriculture. Much is known about the mechanisms by which plants recognise the invading microbes and activate defence signalling. Yet, it remains largely unknown how immunity is achieved. Antimicrobials are important components of the plants\u2019 immune system and this proposal is based on the hypothesis that antimicrobials are secreted upon pathogen attack. We therefore need to know the molecular cargoes of immune-regulated secretion. In this project, we propose to identify the secretome upon pathogen recognition by proteomic approaches in the model system\u00a0", "\u00a0", ".

However, recent changes to pesticide regulations have reduced the availability of pesticides and current reliance on sub-optimal control using parasitoids/predators means there is a need to innovate alternative approaches to aphid control. We have identified several highly effective aphid-killing bacteria. We now have a timely opportunity to capitalise on this discovery to manipulate the bacteria and prove they are safe for use as biocontrol agents. We wish to determine whether we can evolve improved aphid-killing ability in the bacteria to enhance the aphidicidal properties \u2013 this is a natural, non-GM approach, thus making the subsequent new biocontrol bacteria more suitable for use and complementary to an Integrated Pest Management strategy.", "Another key aim of this project will be to examine the effects of aphid biocontrol bacteria on insect ecology and behaviour. This will include studying the effects on natural enemies and non-target insects following exposure to aphids treated with lethal and sub-lethal doses of bacteria. We will also examine the likelihood of resistance occurring in the target pest. Taken together, we believe that these experiments, coupled with ongoing research, will set the foundation for future commercialisation of the biocontrol bacteria and provide growers with a new resource for controlling aphid pests.", "The student will join a research group working on different aspects of microbiology and aphid biology and will be supported by an experienced supervisory team.

Research shows that women at low obstetric risk receive less intervention if cared for in a midwife-led unit. Government policy promotes choice regarding place of birth; however not all NHS Trusts have midwife-led units and therefore this option may require women to cross traditional geographical boundaries and access services with which they are unfamiliar. The study will investigate the evidence for claims that expectations regarding care are shaped by the existing services and that women are less likely to value services that are not currently on offer in their location. Such a preference for the status quo would be a challenge if new options for place of birth are to be promoted. This innovative project will draw on consumer choice theory to identify how best to increase birth place options for women.

Most of the antibiotics we use are made by a group of common soil bacteria called Streptomyces and plants and insects started using them long before humans. Plants including the model Arabidopsis thaliana and important food crops like wheat, potato and rice, all have Streptomyces living inside their roots. Indeed, several recent high profile papers have shown that Streptomyces bacteria are enriched in the rhizosphere (the soil coating the roots) and even more greatly enriched inside the roots of Arabidopsis compared to the surrounding soil. Research published in Science in August 2015 suggests that Streptomyces bacteria are specifically attracted by salicylic acid (SA) that is produced by the plants as part of their general stress response. The suggestion is that Streptomyces (but not all bacteria) can use SA as a food source and thus the plants can specifically select bacteria that are useful to them out of the trillions of bacteria present in the soil. The antibiotics made by these Streptomyces strains are thought to protect the plant roots against fungal infection. In this project we will use Arabidopsis as a model to test (1) if Streptomyces bacteria in the rhizosphere and roots are really using plant-produced SA as food, (2) if any and all Streptomyces strains can live inside plant roots, (3) if SA metabolism is essential for root colonisation by Streptomyces and (4) if Streptomyces-produced antifungals do indeed protect the plants against fungal infection. Ultimately this work will lay the foundation for engineering improved Streptomyces strains for use in agriculture and thus contribute to global food security.", "This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

However, it also possible for the output of a gene to be digital; either on or off. In the digital case, strong positive feedback is required to force the system into one of the two possible states. Such digital regulation is often found at epigenetic target genes, where a particular output must be maintained even after the originating signals have disappeared: an example of molecular memory. In this project, the student will study how these two fundamentally different types of regulation can co-exist at a single target, the floral repressor FLC in the plant Arabidopsis. The work will combine mathematical modeling, involving stochastic spatiotemporal simulations and analytics, together with the latest experimental results from the FLC system. The dual analogue/digital regulation at FLC, together with a wealth of mechanistic experimental studies from our experimental collaborators, makes this an ideal system in which to test our ideas. The student would join a group at the interface between molecular/cell biology and mathematical modeling/biological physics.

This overall aim of this project is to identify and evaluate the bioavailability of minerals in plant foods, with a particular focus on iron because iron deficiency (anaemia) is relatively common in the UK, especially in women of child-bearing age, and is likely to become more widespread with falling meat consumption. The Mediterranean diet is generally accepted as the ideal goal as it is helpful in protecting against the development of chronic diet-responsive diseases. This project will explore the effects of changing dietary patterns on mineral nutrition (iron and bone health) from several different perspectives, and utilizing a variety of techniques and skills. The student will use data from two on-going projects, an EU-funded project (NU-AGE) and a BBSRC DRINC2 project, and will receive specialist training from a network of collaborators with experience in minerals and plant foods. Relationships between food intake and iron status and bone health will be examined (nutritional epidemiology training), and a systematic review of the literature will be undertaken. Laboratory work (in vitro simulated digestion and cell culture techniques) will be carried out to investigate how the iron supply from plant food sources and meat alternatives can be optimized, and the potential for using pea ferritin as an iron supplement will be investigated, including information on iron release during digestion, effects of co-ingested foodstuffs, and mode of uptake into intestinal cells.", "This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

Since they play key roles in development and in responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, it is important that miRNAs are expressed at the right time and place. Therefore there must be a mechanism to degrade miRNAs (miRNA turnover) and that mechanism itself must be carefully regulated to ensure that miRNAs are not present when their function is not required. However, we know very little about this mechanism and its regulation. The successful candidate will carry out a mutant screen to identify genes involved in miRNA turnover. The screening assay relies on a GFP sensor, which is targeted by a miRNA. Expression of the miRNA will be induced by germinating seeds on a special media. After changing the media the miRNA transcription is switched off and the existing miRNA molecules will be degraded, leading to green fluorescence recovery in the seedlings. The successful candidate will screen for lines exhibiting faster or slower GFP recovery. After validation of the mutant phenotype the student will identify the mutant genes by next generation sequencing. Identifying genes involved in miRNA turnover will open up a new field in the RNA silencing area. Understanding the function of those genes and how miRNA turnover is regulated will impact on all aspect of plant biology but also on biomedicine as siRNAs are potential therapeutics.

This PhD project aims to investigate the molecular mechanism by which the DNA methylation pathway regulates sexual lineage development in the model plant Arabidopsis, using a combination of genetics, molecular and cell biology, epigenetics and genomics.

Plant cells are immobile and thus must relay information between cells and tissues by the deployment of mobile molecules or propagating signalling cascades. By such mechanisms plants can activate a stress response far from the site of detection, leading to changes in gene expression in cells that have not yet but are likely to encounter the stress.

E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases are responsible for the final step of ubiquitin transfer, and commonly each Ub ligase is able to target several distinct substrate proteins. However, the choice and preference for recruitment of individual E3 ligase substrates is poorly understood. Our focus in this project will be on a small sub-group of so-called Nedd4 E3 Ub ligases, and primarily the WWP2 Ub ligase, which also plays a key role in development and disease. WWP2 has a unique structural organization that includes four WW domains that specifically select target substrates. The specific objectives of this proposal will be to establish the cellular and molecular details of the interactions of individual and tandem WWP2 domains in WWP2 with their target sequences in it\u2019s main target substrates PTEN, Oct4, Smads and Notch3-ICD, in order to fully understand the biological roles and significance. The experimental approach will include protein expression and structure determination by NMR or X-ray crystallography, binding site mapping, and detailed biophysical characterisation of binding affinities and interaction interfaces. The project will provide an excellent training platform for a PhD student to gain a wide-range of multi-faceted skills relevant to the study of normal and disease-specific biology.

The bacterium is enclosed by a mycomembrane comprising very long chain fatty acids. These fatty acids appear to be chaperoned during their synthesis in the cytoplasm by a highly specialised scaffold in which hydrophobic acyl groups can be captured. This scaffold is a methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (MGLP), which comprises ~20 glucose rings connected by three types of glycosidic linkage and numerous decorations including methyl, glyceryl, succinyl and short chain acyl groups. Only two enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of MGLPs have been unambiguously identified. There is genetic evidence to suggest that other enzymes are involved, but definitive evidence of exactly which enzyme does what and in which order is currently lacking. This studentship will be focussed on addressing these questions using a combination of in vitro enzymology and the analysis of mutants of mycobacteria while taking advantage of recently developed analytical techniques. We have already shown that the MGLP pathway has the potential to be targeted in the development of novel treatments for tuberculosis [Nat. Chem. Biol. 6, 376-384 (2010)]. Therefore, any knowledge gained about MGLP biosynthesis will help support this aim. This project complements our recent discovery and significant progress on the GlgE pathway that is responsible for the biosynthesis of another \u03b1-glucan that is polymeric and without decorations.

In contrast, several plant hormones function by promoting the degradation of proteins that repress gene expression. Auxin is a plant hormone involved at all stages of plant development. One mechanism of auxin signalling was previously elucidated, which at its core has degradation of a family of transcriptional repressors. We have recently shown that auxin also mediates signalling by a mechanism similar to animal steroid hormones by binding to two TFs, thereby changing their structure and activity towards target genes. This discovery suggests an unprecedented flexibility by which hormones regulate development of multicellular organisms and with implications for disciplines as far apart as cancer research and crop improvement.", "This project will focus on the effect that auxin has on the TF complex. We will 1) identify changes in protein composition of this complex depending on auxin levels, 2) test whether the conformational change leads to recruitment of different chromatin remodeling components to target genes and 3) test if auxin binding to this TF complex affect the condensation state of chromatin and thereby the activation/repression of these genes.", "This project will for the first time describe how a TF-hormone complex in plants mediates signal transduction at the molecular level likely revealing a link to epigenetic control of gene expression via dynamic chromatin remodelling. Above and beyond the specific mechanism analysed in this project, this novel pathway may have far-reaching implications for the existence of alternative mechanisms by which hormones regulate plant growth and development.", "This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NRPDTP).

One reason for this is Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) possess an outer membrane (OM); making them impermeable and therefore resistant to many antibiotics that are active against Gram-positives. Infection by the bacterial pathogen, Salmonella is a global issue, with approximately 94 million people contracting gastroenteritis or food poisoning each year. Morbidity of Salmonella infections, particularly associated with outbreaks, is exacerbated by antibiotic resistance, which can lead to more complicated illness in patients. Novel therapeutic agents to treat Salmonella infections are urgently required. An exciting challenge is to decipher the genetic, molecular and biophysical basis of membrane impermeability as a bacterial resistance mechanism. This could expand the use of therapeutic compounds to include those to which Salmonella are currently resistant. This studentship builds from our recent publications that demonstrated that structural and functional overlap exists between the CpxP family of chaperones, and that they are required for Salmonella resistance to antibiotics. We believe that the CpxP chaperones present a potential new opportunity to therapeutically target Salmonella.", "The aims of this studentship are to improve our understanding of the role of the CpxP chaperones in forming the OM and how they function as chaperones.

The specific objective of the research project will be to determine the connectivity of flowering genes that are expressed in the leaves with those that promote development of flowers on the wheat inflorescence, with the focus of analysing gene expression throughout the duration of plant development and in the context of environmental changes in day-length and temperature that occur in the farmer's field. It will combine state-of-the-art genetic resources, including wheat mutant populations and advanced sequence information, with experimental techniques including quantitative PCR and microscopy to characterise genetic pathways regulating inflorescence development. The expected outcome of this project will be a detailed understanding of the connection between the activity of genes that receive environmental signals in the leaves to promote flowering with those that determine the number of seed-producing flowers that form on the inflorescence.

We have recently showed that consumption of broccoli rich diets reduces LDL cholesterol and fasted glucose levels, which suggests that broccoli modulates central metabolic pathways in a manner that may protect against development of chronic diseases. Broccoli is rich in glucoraphanin, a sulphur-containing glucoside that though not bioactive itself is readily metabolised in the gut to bioactive sulforaphane. By using cell and animal models sulforaphane has been linked to the activation of a key transcription factor, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF2), which is responsible for upregulating a host of antioxidant genes by binding to a defined element within their promoter. Recent evidence suggests that NRF2 may also play a role in modulating energy metabolism that though under-explored is likely the mechanism by which broccoli-rich diets promote good health. This PhD project will focus on studying the importance of NRF2 activation in mediating the changes in liver metabolic pathways that can maintain health. This project will, first, use whole genome sequencing techniques to identify the transcriptional cascades that are altered by broccoli bioactives and NRF2 and understand their effect on fatty acid metabolism. There will also be opportunity to engineer novel genetic knockout human cells through genome editing to specifically understand the importance of nrf2 in mediating metabolic regulation by dietary bioactives.

This project involves study of a novel diiron centre containing isoprene monooxygenase enzyme from the bacterium Rhodococcus. This enzyme will be purified and then characterized at the biochemical level. The biotechnological potential of the enzyme for the production of epoxides and chiral synthons will also be investigated.

We study the development of skeletal muscle cells, which differentiate into multinucleated contractile fibres that facilitate voluntary movements and maintain posture. In vertebrate embryos, all skeletal muscles in the trunk and limbs are derived from somites. In general, the differentiation of a cell from a progenitor into a mature, fully differentiated cell type is a gradual process during an organism\u2019s development, when the potency of progenitors becomes progressively restricted towards a particular cell type. This is mediated by epigenetic changes to the genome to control gene activity. Interestingly, most of this cellular programming is dynamic and reversible \u2013 given the right signals \u2013 and this is being exploited in stem cell science, which holds lots of promise for future cell based therapies.\u00a0 In this project, the student will investigate the role of chromatin-remodeling complexes called BAF/Brg1.

Hunger and level of energy-expenditure are controlled by a discrete population of neurons in an area of the brain called hypothalamus. Broadly, these neurons occur as two different subtypes and work in a \u2018tug of war\u2019 manner to induce state of hunger versus fullness. In this project, the student will ask whether ageing-related anorexia is due to a progressive decline in the number and/or functioning of specific subset of these neurons. Using a powerful set of transgenic reporter mice, the student will accurately measure and compare these changes in the brain of young, middle-aged and heavily aged mice. To gain insight into molecular changes, the student will also examine changes in hypothalamic genes that are differentially turned on or off, or are reduced or elevated with ageing. In a complementary strand, the student will ask whether there is a reduced supply of new neurons to circuits that control appetite, by a newly-discovered population of hypothalamic neural stem/progenitor cells, called tanycytes. Moreover, the student will test whether genetic knockdown or over-expression of certain genes expressed by tanycytes can enhance or reduce hypothalamic neurogenesis in the aged brain as means of counteracting neuronal loss in this region. These studies suit a highly-motivated student interested in neurosciences, who will become trained in a host of cellular and molecular techniques ranging from tissue sectioning, immunolabelling and high resolution image capture/analysis, to bioinformatics.

Underlying this drawdown of CO2 from the atmosphere is the fixing of carbon by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the oceanic surface layers. The grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton enhances the rate at which this \u2018fixed\u2019 carbon is transported to, and stored in, the deeper layers of the ocean. Global models of the carbon cycle make very simplistic assumptions in terms of these grazing interactions, which are likely to be flawed. The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of how zooplankton feed on phytoplankton, particularly in polar-regions, where a large amount of CO2 drawdown takes place. This work will improve predictions on how marine ecosystems will respond to increasing CO2 emissions and help determine how much anthropogenic CO2 can continue to be absorbed by the oceans.", "Research methodology This project will focus on a newly discovered aspect in phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions \u2013 the undertaking of feeding forays between thin phytoplankton layers. These forays may be widely prevalent but, until now, have been difficult to detect with conventional sampling methods. This project will deploy state-of-the-art instrumentation to detect these forays and how they may influence physiological cycles in zooplankton grazers. The project will also undertake modelling analyses to consider how such feeding forays may increase individual fitness and control growth in phytoplankton populations.", "Training The successful candidate will participate in oceanographic sampling campaigns for which they will receive training in sea-survival and safe field-laboratory practice. They will participate in the deployment of sampling gear, including nets and moorings, and become competent in the identification- and handling of zooplankton.

These facets depend on NMDA receptors and their role in controlling the plasticity of excitatory synapses. NMDA receptors in cortical areas of the brain are largely composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. Recently, a growing number of familial and de novo disease-linked mutations have been discovered in the genes giving rise to these NMDA receptor subunits (Burnashev and Szepetowski, 2015; Yuan et al., 2015). For the human GluN2B receptor, there appears to be a correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype: whereas loss-of-function mutations are linked to intellectual disability, gain-of-function mutations are associated with seizure disorders (Burnashev and Szepetowski, 2015; Lemke et al. 2014). In contrast, for the GluN2A subunit, both reported gain- and presumed loss-of-function mutations in the receptor are usually linked to a seizure disorder (Burnashev and Szepetowski, 2015; Lemke et al. 2013). Therefore, it appears that investigating how mutations affect channel expression and biophysics is not sufficient to explain pathogenesis of these genetic disease cases. Instead, recent evidence from manipulation of NMDA receptor subunit expression in mice suggests that changes in synaptic transmission might be a better correlate to the human disease phenotype (Gray et al., 2011). This project aims to test the hypothesis that cell autonomous effects of human disease mutations in GluN2A and B subunits have contrasting effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity at hippocampal synapses.", "In addition to cloning NMDA receptor mutants and characterizing their expression and function in heterologous cells, the PhD project will make use of conditional knockout mice of mutant NMDA receptor subunits to perform cutting-edge molecular replacement experiments in cultured brain slices and patch-clamp recordings of synaptic currents/potentials (Granger et al., 2011).

It is key to the adaptive potential of populations, affecting their probability of extinction. How genetic variation is maintained in natural populations, especially small ones, is therefore a fundamental question in evolutionary and conservation biology. Nowhere is diversity more important than at immune genes, which underpin the ability of individuals and populations to combat pathogens.

Of particular interest here are the rapidly developing economies of many countries in South and East Asia (Leedham Elvidge et al., ACP, 2015). Another major concern is changes to transport patterns within the stratosphere, which are hard to track.

This usually leads to large fluxes of heat and moisture from the ocean into the atmosphere and often the formation of low-level convective clouds, sometimes developing from stratocumulus decks. Cold-air outbreaks occur frequently over the subpolar seas and commonly affect the UK weather in winter, often leading to snow showers that are important to forecast.They are also important within the climate system as the large surface heat fluxes lead to dramatic cooling, forcing ocean convection and sea-ice formation, and generating dense water masses that feed into the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a key component of the global ocean circulation. Consequently it is vital that cold-air outbreaks are well-represented in numerical weather and climate prediction models.", "Although the broad-scale characteristics of cold-air outbreaks are generally well-represented in models, recent studies have highlighted a number of systematic problems, e.g. the simulated surface heat fluxes can be vastly different to those observed; and it is very difficult to obtain the correct cloud characteristics, with consequences for the radiation budget.", "In this project you will investigate cold-air outbreaks using a number of case studies gathered from aircraft-based field campaigns.

Thermal stratification, likely to become more common under climate change, favours smaller diatoms with higher surface-to-volume ratios and therefore higher nutrient uptake efficiency and slower sinking rates.", "To identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning the cell size in diatoms linked to their success under changing environmental conditions, we have genetically modified (GM) ", "to give cell lines with different cell sizes.

Furthermore, GMTp will be characterized in comparison to wild-type Tp cultures in terms of differences in key physiological processes including nutrient uptake and storage, photosynthesis and primary metabolism. The impact of the cell size on aggregation and sinking will be studied by live-cell imaging for different GMTp and WT cell lines.", "The student will receive training in the areas of next-generation sequencing, basic bioinformatics, proteomics and basic cell physiology.

RPS4 is a typical TIR-NB-LRR R protein, but the RRS1 TIR-NB-LRR R protein also carries a WRKY DNA binding domain, that acts as a \u201cbait\u201d that detects the presence and/or activity of AvrRps4 and PopP2 (Williams et al 2014; 10.1126/science.1247357 Sarris et al 2015; 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.024).", "Activation of defence by RPS4/RRS1 results in rapid induction of ~40 ETI genes, including genes for salicylic acid biosynthesis, other defence enzymes and transcription regulators (Sohn et al, 2014 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004655).\u00a0", "The goal of the studentship is to understand how RPS4/RRS1 activates these ~40 coregulated ETI genes in Arabidopsis upon effector perception.

Winds blow dust into the atmosphere, where it absorbs solar radiation, heating the atmosphere, while cooling the surface underneath it, significantly altering climate and weather on continental scales. When deposited in the ocean the iron that it contains can stimulate the growth of marine life, which can then reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, cooling the climate globally.", "In the Precambrian (>700 million years ago), before the colonization of Earth\u2019s land surface by plants and forests, much more of the land surface could have produced airborne dust, so it is very likely that wind-borne dust was far more prevalent over large parts of the surface compared to the present day. However, in the deep past of the Archean (3-4 billion years ago), when continental land mass was much smaller in area, there may have been considerably less dust in the atmosphere than now. We currently have very little understanding of how dusty the planet was in the deep past, or what role this may have played in controlling climate.", "Using numerical models and geochemical proxy data the successful applicant will investigate the possible role of dust on the atmosphere, the ocean geochemistry and the climate of the Precambrian.

Design of protein catalysts with efficiency comparable to natural enzymes remains a distant dream; if we could design protein catalysts as powerful as enzymes, the range of applications in synthesis, \u2018green\u2019 chemistry and biotechnology would be huge.\u00a0Perhaps the most controversial question in current enzymology is the possible role of protein dynamics in catalysis, particularly for enzyme reactions involving quantum tunnelling (see our Perspective, Glowacki et al., Nature Chemistry doi:10.1038/nchem.1244, 2012). The essential question is: how do motions of an enzyme contribute to its catalytic activity? This project will investigate the role of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis. Far from being an esoteric phenomenon in biology, quantum tunnelling is an important factor in many enzymes (Masgrau et al. Science 2006). Many enzyme-catalysed reactions show KIEs with complex temperature dependence, which cannot be explained by simple (e.g. single barrier) models. It has been proposed that protein dynamics are crucial in \u2018driving\u2019 reactions. This question has been examined by experimental and theoretical analysis of \u2018heavy\u2019, completely isotopically substituted enzymes (Luk et al. PNAS 2013). In this project, we will develop simulation methods for direct calculation of these effects by quantum dynamical molecular simulations. These will apply ring polymer molecular dynamics techniques based on the path integral formalism for direct treatment of quantum effects (Boekelhide et al. PNAS 2011), applicable even for highly delocalized systems for which reaction path based methods may fail.\u00a0We will develop and use empirical valence bond (EVB) potential energy functions, parameterized against our high-level QM/MM calculations, for accurate atomistic representation of the reacting enzyme systems. We will directly calculate the contribution of quantum effects using coupled thermodynamic integration simulations. Uniquely, this will give directly the contribution of quantum effects to the barrier at all temperatures studied.\u00a0We will apply these combined methods to study reactions catalysed by several important enzymes. The project will involve a variety of simulation techniques, including molecular dynamics simulations of protein complexes to examine conformational effects, and analysis of protein motions during all stages of the catalytic cycle, providing a broad training.\u00a0", "Please make an online application for this PhD position at ", "For further details please see ", "UK or EU citizen fully funded", "Successful applicants to TMCS typically hold a first class honours degree (or equivalent) in Chemistry or a closely related discipline.", "Full funding of fees and stipend for 4 years.", "Project queries: Adrian Mulholland ", "\u00a0 TMCS queries: ", "Type / Role:", "Subject Area(s):", "Location(s):", "South West England"], "university": ["TMCS studentship: Dynamics and catalysis in enzymes", "<strong>University of Bristol</strong>", "<strong>The project: </strong>", "<strong>Dynamics and catalysis in enzymes</strong>", "<strong>\u00a0</strong>", "<strong>\u00a0</strong>", "<strong>Candidate requirements:\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>", "<strong>Funding: </strong>", "<strong>Contacts:\u00a0 </strong>"], "subjectarea": ["Physical and Environmental Sciences"], "details": ["<div class=\"advert-details-box\">\n            <table class=\"advert-details advert-details-left\">\n\n                                <tr id=\"qualification-type\">\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Qualification type:</td>\n                    <td>PhD</td>\n                </tr>\n                \n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Location:</td>\n                    <td>Bristol</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                                <tr id=\"funding-for\">\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Funding for:</td>\n                    <td>UK Students, EU Students</td>\n                </tr>\n                \n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Funding amount:</td>\n                    <td>\n                                            \u00a314,057\n                                                                                                                                                            </td>\n                </tr>\n\n                                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Hours:</td>\n                    <td>Full Time</td>\n                </tr>\n                                            </table>\n            <table class=\"advert-details advert-details-right\">\n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Placed on:</td>\n                    <td>22nd September 2015</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                                        <td class=\"detail-heading\">Closes:</td>\n                    <td>20th November 2015</td>\n                                    </tr>\n                <tr>\n                                    </tr>\n                                <tr>\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a class=\"button-link\" href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/enhanced/employer/university-of-bristol/\"><span class=\"purple-star\">\u2605</span> View Employer Profile</a>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                            </table>\n            </div>"], "jobtype": ["PhD", "Physical and Environmental Sciences", "Chemistry"]},

Using an estimated load ratio of 5% of lumpfish to salmon, several million lumpfish are required by the salmon industry in the UK each year. Currently all lumpfish are derived from wild parents, which may pose a strain on natural populations. For the use of lumpfish to be fully sustainable, a strategy needs to be developed to minimise any impacts on the fishery and cleaner fish need to be reared entirely in captivity. Our commercial sponsor, Marine Harvest Scotland, will support a PhD student to address applied questions in lumpfish research. This is an excellent opportunity for a suitably qualified and motivated student to carry out research on sustainable aquaculture and natural pest control. Very little is known about this species, so the student will have the opportunity to develop the project aims around his/her own areas of interest.

Many existing biosensor technologies offer benefits in specific application areas but are limited for widespread use in point-of-care applications due to the requirements for low cost, high sensitivity and portability. The new graphene based electro-chemical sensors which will be developed during this project are expected to be highly sensitive, reliable, miniaturised and portable and suitable for point-of-care dementia applications.

We are specifically focused in the development of innovative solutions for planning and control synthesis over models of dynamical systems, in particular of autonomous aerial robotics or of multi-agent compositions of ground vehicles. The project will investigate the verification and control of complex models in robotics, encompassing the presence of continuous physical components, as well as of discrete digital software and actuation: this naturally yields a cyber-physical modelling setup, which is challenging for verification and control tasks.", "The convergence of learning and verification techniques is key in this project. In verification, the use of machine learning to guess simple linear program invariants is promising, but complex invariants, in particular for the CPS setup mentioned above, appear to be difficult for existing statistical learning techniques. Statistical approaches in model checking are promising in terms of scalability, but often lack providing stringent assertions that are required for safety verification tasks. On the other hand, key algorithmic ideas in verification such as efficient splitting and learning in conflict-driven clause learning and symbolic reasoning about sets have the potential to improve existing learning techniques. Further, we are interested in the integration of advanced, adaptive model learning techniques from data, with successful model-based approaches for verification, control and planning.

One of the big unknowns associated with the marine carbon cycle is the role of shelf seas in absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and exporting it to the deep ocean. The northern North Sea is probably one of the most important seas in this respect. It has strong exchange with the North Atlantic across the northern boundary.

For example, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method that benefits clinicians in monitoring human brain disease progression, planning neurosurgery and studying brain development. DTI data analysis must account for the diffusion tensor, which has a complicated mathematical structure, the three-dimensional spatial characteristics of the image, and the existence of complicated fibre structures in the brain. The combination of these aspects makes diffusion tensor image analysis one of the most challenging topics in the area of medical image analysis.

It has only recently become apparent that a variety of low-valent main-group compounds can perform transition-metal like small molecule activation processes (e.g. dihydrogen activation), thus opening the door to the possibility of new main-group catalysed chemical transformations which may provide alternatives to traditional metal-based processes. We have ongoing research efforts that look to prepare novel low-valent main-group systems which can activate small molecules (e.g. H", ", CO, CO", ") and which can act as precursors or building blocks for functional materials (e.g. optically active or conductive polymers). We are also interested in developing analogies between stereotypical reactivity in transition metals and that observed for main group compounds, for example in extending reversible oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactivity to the p-block.", "This project will develop low valent group 13/15 and group 14 compounds and investigate their reactivity towards small molecules, in addition to investigating their use as precursors to molecular clusters that will be studied as models for bulk semiconducting materials.", "Applicants should possess a recent chemistry degree (first class or 2(i), or equivalent).

Previous experience in the preparation and manipulation of air- and moisture-sensitive compounds is highly desirable.", "The student undertaking this project will receive training in a wide variety of techniques. Synthesis of both organic (e.g. ligands) and inorganic main-group compounds, frequently under inert atmosphere, will be required. Multinuclear NMR and UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography will also be important techniques. The practical skills gained will be complemented by the scientific problem solving and presentations required in group meetings, and the student will have opportunities to present their work at suitable international conferences.", "The fully-funded (UK/EU tuition fees & stipend) 36-month PhD studentship is available to start between 1 September 2015 and January 2016.

So, if one could print pharmaceuticals on demand, then it would in theory be possible to acquire ones personal medicine in a manner similar to ordering a fast-food meal!", " This PhD work will develop a number of powder-based 3D printers designed to mix and dispense combinations of materials and binders necessary for the production of a \u2018tablet\u2019 to be used for pharmaceutical purposes.

Food formulators have recently begun exploring commercial advantages associated with increases in the nutritional/functional value of food products through simple structuring approaches designed to enable the targeted release of actives (nutrients, flavours, etc.). Gel particles offer an attractive microstructure for the encapsulation/release of actives, and are increasingly utilised by the food industry. However, the applicability of current processing approaches for microencapsulation within gel particulates (e.g. spray drying,) is significantly hampered by several issues; e.g. encapsulation efficiency is compromised during the temperature and osmotic extremes involved in spray drying.", "This PhD project aims to investigate the use of fluid gel structures for the encapsulation and release of a range of (bio)actives and to assess whether these systems can overcome the issues associated with existing strategies. Fluid gels are formed by application of shear to a biopolymer solution undergoing gelation; as a result, a concentrated suspension of gelled particles is formed. Fluid gel manufacture involves the use of conventional high shear equipment and therefore fabrication of these systems at an industrial scale is achievable. The project will investigate the effect of fluid gel microstructure on the encapsulation (efficiency) of a range of actives. Fluid gel properties will be controlled by formulation/process parameters; e.g. the rate of deformation during mixing. The achievable level of control over the fluid gels size and material properties, suggests that fabrication of systems that remain \u2018undetected\u2019 upon consumption is feasible, and the project will determine the microstructural/processing conditions necessary for this.

Maintaining competitiveness of the British catalyst industry requires the continued development of ever higher-performance products, delivering improved catalytic activity and chemical selectivity. For products catalysing diffusion-limited reaction systems, increasing the pellet effectiveness factor is key to delivering improved performance. This requires a detailed understanding of the factors in pellet pore structure that limit mass transport, and the parameters in the manufacturing process that produce these particular pore structure features. This project will consider the relationship between pellet forming processes, and pellet transport properties, as mediated by the pellet structural characteristics that a particular set of forming conditions produce. It will consider how changing particular parameters of the manufacturing process leads to specific changes in the pellet structure, and determine the impact of those features on the rate of mass transport. The project will thus be run in collaboration with the catalyst company Johnson Matthey, and will potentially include opportunities to work closely with them.", "Applicants would be expected to possess at least an upper-second class degree (or equivalent) in chemical engineering, other engineering disciplines, or physical sciences.

This progressive muscle weakness results in reduced mobility, independence and quality of life, and increased incidence of frailty-related falls and injury in ageing populations. A commonly observed feature that might contribute to age-related muscle decline is blunted growth responses to exercise training, and a likely impairment in muscular regeneration from individual bouts of activity. Whilst the mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are poorly understood, failure of exercise-responsive molecular signals are logical candidates for investigation. However, many cross-talking signalling pathways are involved in the post-exercise remodelling process, and systematic evaluation of all associated regulatory molecules and their dysregulation in ageing muscle is not feasible in humans. This project will therefore employ an interdisciplinary approach to predict novel signalling networks regulating exercise-induced metabolic/functional adaptation, and examine the physiological role of these networks directly in ageing people during acute post-exercise muscle remodelling. Bioinformatic predictive modelling will be used to filter candidate network components involved in muscle adaptation to exercise. The relevance of these networks to ageing muscle decline will then be examined using state-of-the-art immunofluorescent imaging techniques, applied to human muscle biopsy samples collected during the acute post-exercise remodelling period. The dynamic temporo-spatial responses of putative regulators of muscle regeneration, overlaid onto the direct functional responses to exercise in humans, will provide new insight into the mechanisms underpinning exercise-mediated muscle adaptation and its deregulation during the ageing process.", "This project is one of a number that are in competition for funding from the ", ".

The critical trigger for synaptic plasticity is the influx of calcium ions into very small compartments of neurones called spines. It has been proposed that the amount of calcium that flows into the neurone determines whether the synapse increases or decreases its strength. In this hypothesis a large influx of calcium leads to a strengthening of the synapse whereas a smaller influx of calcium leads to a weakening. This is a simple and elegant theory that has some evidence to support it and some against. However, none of the currently available evidence directly measures calcium influx into the very small spines.", "We are going to investigate the influx of calcium into neurones using a combination of mathematical modelling and experiments done by filling neurones with dyes that fluoresce when calcium is present. Because the structures we wish to image calcium in are very small (approximately 1 millionth of a metre in diameter) we need to use a microscope and a high-powered laser to be able to see changes in calcium with a high enough resolution. Importantly in order to dissect the mechanisms and hence understand the regulation of calcium dynamics in the small spine volume we develop and analyse three-dimensional mathematical models using finite element methods.", "This work is important because it will lead to a wealth of new information about synaptic plasticity, and hence learning and memory mechanisms. Dysfunction in the ability to undergo synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie the altered neuronal activity in several brain diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia and autism. Therefore, the mechanisms that we will study in this research will add to our knowledge about these debilitating diseases, and may contribute to developing therapies.", "This project is one of a number that are in competition for funding from the ", ".

While there has been considerable research into storm erosion of beaches, research into beach recovery following storms is very limited. The lack of datasets which quantify the role of storm erosion-recovery cycles in longer-term beach change is recognised as a limiting factor in our understanding of these processes. Fundamentally, this paucity of suitable data is due to the practical difficulties involved in making accurate, rapid and repeat beach profile measurements immediately pre-, during- and post-storm.\u00a0", "We will address that data gap through an innovative approach to data collection using crowd-sourcing. The UK is home to an informal network of recreational beach users who visit beaches daily to provide online updates of surfing conditions around the coastline and who have a strong interest in the coast. This project will develop a series of low-cost \u201cRapid Beach Survey Kits\u201d which will be distributed to volunteers from the UK surf community (typically surf schools and surf shops) with whom Dr Blenkinsopp has communicated and who are willing to complete at least weekly surveys of their local beaches.", "This crowd-sourced approach will enable highly-regular beach survey data to be collected from multiple beaches at low-cost. Analysis of this data, in conjunction with selected existing storm-response geospatial datasets, will provide new insight into storm erosion and subsequent beach recovery by comparing beach response at multiple sites during the same storm. The data also provide an ideal dataset to underpin development of an equilibrium/behavioural approach to modelling beach erosion-recovery response.\u00a0", "We seek applicants who can demonstrate strong quantitative skills, a desire to be involved in field data collection and a creative and independent approach to solving research questions.

Therefore, there is a high demand to develop new thermal management technologies, in which advanced thermal management materials are the core elements for electronic heat sinks, heat exchangers and power electronics cooling etc. This programme will focus on development of advanced nanocomposites with desired properties for targeted specific thermal management applications. Systematic characterisations on morphology, chemical composition and crystal structure of the nanocomposites will be carried out, as well as assessment of mechanical and thermal properties. One of the critical focuses is to gain deep understanding of the process-structure-property relationships of produced nanocomposites, particularly, to tailor the microstructure for desired thermal properties by different material processing methods.", "For UK/EU candidates, the studentship will cover PhD tuition fees (at the UK/EU rate) and a tax free stipend for three years (\u00a314,057 for the 2015-16 academic year).

It is envisaged that this technology, exclusive to the 3DPRG, will open up a number of exciting opportunities including, but not limited to, the fabrication of novel electrical conductive componentry, new generation 3D smart devices and structural multi-functional components.", "The success of the technology will rely on the adhesion of dispensed metal droplets on a solid substrate or pre-deposited droplet patterns. The aim of the project associated with the advertised scholarship is thus to elucidate the possible interactions between the dispensed liquid metal droplets and solid surfaces of various nature upon droplet impact. The project will take into account the condition of the jetting process (including the condition of the jetted droplets and the build environment) and the nature of the materials involved that will determine the droplet spreading and the solid solution of the materials in contact. This research will be conducted within a wider research team comprising of academics, post-doctoral researchers and technical staff. Operating as part of a collaborative aim, this experimental research will build on the computational models of the droplet-surface interaction that will be developed in parallel within the group.", "The research will therefore involve elements of surface engineering, metallurgy and microscopy.", "The studentship will cover PhD tuition fees (at the UK/EU rate) and a tax free stipend for three years (\u00a314,057 for the 2015-16 academic year).

For these reasons, we are particularly interested in applying ideas from systems thinking (soft systems, viable systems theory and system dynamics), complexity science (in both objectivist and interpretivist traditions) and network theory (in terms of both social and business networks, as well as theories of sociomateriality) to these phenomena.", "For more information about the Faculty of Business visit: ", "We are looking to recruit a candidate of the highest quality and who is capable of submitting a PhD thesis within 3 years and funding will cover the three year period subject to the candidate making satisfactory progress annually.

This research project is framed in the context of developing bamboo standards, for which the first step is deemed to be the development of strength grading procedures, which Coventry University is currently pioneering. The next step is the development of structural design theory, of which connection design forms a fundamental part. Methods would include, but are not limited to dowelled connections.", "Bamboo\u2019s appeal as a structural material includes its remarkable strength, sustainability and low-cost. The techniques or methods that are developed need to be sufficiently reliable to justify their adoption, yet not so costly that makes their adoption unlikely.", "Due to the geographical distribution of bamboo for structural applications, travel is likely to be required.", "The school of Energy, Construction and Environment and the Centre for Low Impact Buildings has an established reputation in materials and structures research, offering arguably the largest structures laboratory in the West Midlands and excellent links to industry. The project counts with all the necessary research equipment and materials (including bamboo) and test facilities.

However the compounds produced in nature do not necessarily possess the activity or properties required for drug development and further synthetic transformations are often necessary to generate the final optimised compound. The additional synthetic-steps required to transform the natural product into a more effective derivative increases costs and often involves reagents and solvents that are expensive and polluting. Consequently, a process that can circumvent the need for additional synthetic transformations would provide a cleaner and more competitive route to many valuable products including essential antibiotics that are required to combat emerging antimicrobial resistance. This project will combine new synthetic biology technologies, state-of-the art advancements in natural products bioengineering and enzyme directed evolution to develop a single fermentation-based process that can deliver important antibiotics, obviating the need for any additional synthetic transformations. This project is of major interest to GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies, and the PhD student will therefore benefit from close contact and placement periods at GSK as well as a significantly enhanced stipend. Training in Manchester and at GSK will include: Protein engineering, directed evolution, enzyme characterisation and assays. There will also be scope within the project to develop skills in molecular biology and microbiology.

This flexibilisation manifests as zero-hours contracting, greater reliance on temporary and contingent workers, and a degree of enforced self-employment, leading some scholars to express concerns about the apparent degradation of the employment relationship (e.g. Atzeni, 2014).

The new RNA-based small-molecule controlled expression systems will be valuable for gene functional analysis and in biotechnological applications including protein production, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. To address this major challenge, we will re-engineer purine and tetrahydrofolate riboswitches, altering their specificity from endogenous metabolites to synthetic ligands. This group of riboswitches function at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and include both ON and OFF switches, maximising the options for downstream applications. These switches also afford the greatest opportunity for structure-guided rational design of alternative effector molecules with desirable physicochemical properties. The modularity of orthogonal riboswitches will be explored using serial arrangements of switches to introduce digital control of expression outputs. The exchange of aptamer and expression domains between different riboswitches will also be exploited, to diversify the expression outputs for a given ligand. The assembly of a library of modular riboswitch components that function through different mechanisms will facilitate transferability to different species, from industrially important microorganisms to clinically relevant pathogens, where new expression tools are urgently required. Training will include: ligand design and synthesis, RNA biochemistry, biomolecular interactions, structural and molecular biology.

Many migrants enter the hospitality and tourism labour market at operational levels, with a view to moving out of these sectors once they develop adequate language skills, experiential capital and networks. Labour mobility also has a spatial dimension, with some migrants returning to their countries of origin and others moving to new geographical locations. This study seeks to examine the experiences of migrants who remain employed in hospitality and tourism and develop careers. It considers how career trajectories evolve and the experiences of transition across different parts of the labour market. There is scope to consider the management implications of migrants assuming senior positions within organisations. The study should also examine broader social, economic and political factors shaping individual migrant experiences, including, for example, economic (in)stability and inequality across European states, changes in family status, political and media discourses associated with the EU and migration, and ongoing changes to the migrant workforce.

Around 10% of patients on dialysis or transplanted in the UK have ADPKD and it is estimated that this costs \u00a360 million per annum to the NHS. There are currently no effective drugs for slowing progression in the 50% of ADPKD patients destined to develop end-stage renal failure. There is also considerable variability in phenotypic disease expression between patients implicating both genetic and environmental factors. An exciting new area of biology is the discovery that a new family of regulatory RNAs, named microRNAs (miRNAs) act as posttranscriptional repressors by binding the 3\u2019UTR of multiple target genes. MiRNAs have already been implicated in diverse biologic and pathologic processes and are emerging as important players in modifying the kidney phenotype in health and disease. Potentially they could also act as biomarkers of disease severity and be new molecular targets for treatment. This project will seek to validate differentially expressed miRNAs found in human ADPKD and their functional effect on the expression of a cystic phenotype using human cell culture model system. Work using zebrafish models of disease will be conducted at the world leading MRC Centre for Developmental Biology and Genetics. The successful applicant will work in a fast moving area of biology relevant to a major human genetic disease with clinical translational potential.

In posing this question the report authors point to a series of concerns about management education including: the need to inculcate ideas of corporate and global social responsibility through management education; the place of business ethics in the curriculum; and the future role of business students as professionals and potential \u2018global citizens\u2019.\u00a0 The Carnegie report argues for the instantiation of a western \u2018liberal\u2019 education in business schools, as a way of addressing such concerns. The United Nations\u2019 Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative shares a similar vision, with its explicit purpose being to encourage business schools to develop the capabilities of students as global citizens who are able to generate sustainable value for both business and society. Implicit in both approaches is the view that management education has a particular social responsibility, which is currently unfulfilled. While such approaches have driven a burgeoning range of case studies aimed at embedding social responsibility within Business Schools, questions remain. PhD proposals are invited which seek to explore and theorize the role of management education in a globalised world.

Over the last three decades a number of models were developed to estimate the carbon uptake (primary productivity) of vegetation. One such group of models, called the production efficiency models, rely on remote sensing data to estimate the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) absorbed by Vegetation and the light use efficiency to provide estimates of carbon uptake. However, these model predictions have uncertainties due to (i) inaccuracies in quantification of light absorbed by photosynthetic element of plant canopy, (ii) errors in land cover classification and (iii) coarse scale meteorological data. A new model has been developed at the University of Southampton called the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF) Model to estimate terrestrial primary productivity using data from ESA\u2019s MERIS sensor. The project will contribute to the further development of the model by (i) investigating the possibility of incorporating soil moisture constrain (vapour pressure deficit) derived from remote sensing data (such as SMOS); (ii) Explore the possibility of using Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) derived from Geostationary data, (iii) validating the model across the globe (particularly for tropical forests) and (iv) develop this model for potential implementation using\u00a0 ESA\u2019s future Sentinel 3 data set. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "GECEO has a long-standing and sustained international reputation in areas of remote sensing of vegetation, carbon flux, vegetation burning and agriculture monitoring with a strong link with European Space Agency and publication in world-class journals.

In the cardiac literature, the red cell membrane cholesterol (RCMC) levels in patients with acute chest pain are significantly higher in those with acute myocardial infarction (another condition caused by plaque rupture) compared to those with stable angina.

We are interested in the cellular response to infection and inflammation, involving the white blood cells (leukocytes) of the host. To investigate the complex cellular and signalling interactions involved in these processes our model of choice is the zebrafish embryo infected with Mycobacterium marinum (the fish version of tuberculosis). Zebrafish embryos have an innate immune response comparable to our own, and are transparent, allowing detailed spatial and temporal analysis of leukocyte behaviour during infection and inflammation.", "We are specifically interested in hypoxia inducible factor alpha (Hif-\u03b1) signalling, a transcription factor that is upregulated when cells are in areas of low levels of oxygen.

There are a rapidly growing number of studies on the creative digital economy. Despite this, there has been a relative neglect of how both consultancy and in-house design are being reshaped and affected. One view is that the impacts in design are more limited and distinctive but there has been little systematic research to support these claims. Another, in contrast, is that the primary effect of digitisation on design is to break down its boundaries to absorb design in other industries and produce the rapid growth of hybrid design/digital firms.\u00a0", "Digitisation is a shorthand term for a multiple range of computer-based processes in design, production and the consumption so that its relevance to design industries needs to be examined carefully. The relative neglect of digitisation in design is surprising given that computer aided design has become so widespread and that there has a growing recognition of the importance of clusters of designers, and design based innovation systems, to the success of cities and quality manufacturing. The aim of this project would be to examine digitisation in different types of design, both in-house and consultancy, and to examine how these processes are interacting with the spatialities, specialisations and practices of the sector. Is there a radical re-mixing of design activity across creative industries and what are the relations to the established spaces of design? It would use a comparative methodology and compare both across design sectors and across different cities with significant design clusters.

The implications of these disparities are significant, including higher risk for cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and other chronic diseases, as well as higher rates of use for alcohol, marijuana, and other substances.", "The determinants of smoking behaviour among LGBT people, however, are less clear. Some theorize that high rates of smoking among LGBT people are attributable to mental health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression) caused by the stigma and prejudice they face on a routine basis. Others suggest that the high prevalence of smoking in LGBT people stems from insecurities associated with coming out and identity development (e.g., body image issues, pressure to conform to masculine stereotypes), or from adverse responses to those identities, such as social rejection, victimization, and internalized homophobia. Although LGBT smokers demonstrate rates of intent to quit that are similar to their heterosexual counterparts, they are less successful in quitting, suggesting a need for LGBT-specific smoking cessation interventions.", "The vast majority of research on smoking and LGBT people has been carried out in the United States, though British research by King et al. (2003) suggests an elevated rate of smoking in gay vs. heterosexual men (45% vs. 42%) and lesbian vs. heterosexual women (45% vs. 36%). A recent study of British youth (Hagger-Johnson et al. 2013) finds similarly elevated rates of smoking in gay/lesbian youth (40%) and bisexual youth (41%) vs. heterosexual youth (22%). Few studies in the UK, however, have sought to unravel the causes of these disparities in the same detail as in the US context. Available UK datasets offer considerable potential for investigating this critical health issue and its implications for current National Health Service (NHS) policies and potential anti-smoking interventions. It is on this investigation that the proposed studentship will focus. It is envisioned that the appointed PhD student will develop research questions of his/her own, in addition to the following:", "(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What are the measurable determinants of LGBT smoking disparities in the UK and do they differ from those observed in other countries?", "(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To what degree is smoking linked with other risk behaviours (e.g., drug use, unprotected sex) and longer-term health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer) in the LGBT population vs. the heterosexual population?", "(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does smoking behaviour in the LGBT population vary differently with age and historical time compared to the heterosexual population?", "(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are there geographical variations (e.g., urban vs. rural) with respect to smoking behaviour in the LGBT population?", "(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What are the structural factors that undergird LGBT smoking disparities in the UK?", "?", "For full details and information on how to apply please visit:", "?", "Type / Role:", "Subject Area(s):", "Location(s):", "South East England"], "university": ["Fully funded PhD opportunity (Competition, Home/EU): Determinants and Correlates of Smoking Behaviours among LGBT People in the United Kingdom", "<strong>University of Southampton</strong>"], "subjectarea": ["Health and Medical", "Psychology", "Social Sciences and Social Care"], "details": ["<div class=\"advert-details-box\">\n            <table class=\"advert-details advert-details-left\">\n\n                                <tr id=\"qualification-type\">\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Qualification type:</td>\n                    <td>PhD</td>\n                </tr>\n                \n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Location:</td>\n                    <td>Southampton</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                                <tr id=\"funding-for\">\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Funding for:</td>\n                    <td>UK Students, EU Students</td>\n                </tr>\n                \n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Funding amount:</td>\n                    <td>\n                                            Not specified\n                                                                                </td>\n                </tr>\n\n                                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Hours:</td>\n                    <td>Full Time</td>\n                </tr>\n                                            </table>\n            <table class=\"advert-details advert-details-right\">\n                <tr>\n                    <td class=\"detail-heading\">Placed on:</td>\n                    <td>5th November 2015</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                                        <td class=\"detail-heading\">Closes:</td>\n                    <td>8th January 2016</td>\n                                    </tr>\n                <tr>\n                                    </tr>\n                                <tr>\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a class=\"button-link\" href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/enhanced/employer/university-of-southampton/\"><span class=\"purple-star\">\u2605</span> View Employer Profile</a>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                            </table>\n            </div>"], "jobtype": ["PhD", "Health and Medical", "Medicine and Dentistry", "Psychology", "Social Sciences and Social Care", "Sociology", "Other Social Sciences"]}]
